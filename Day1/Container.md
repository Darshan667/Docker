# Docker
### 1. What is Docker
* A container is a lightweight, standalone package that includes an application and all dependencies(libraries, binaries and configuration files).
* Unlike virtual machines, containers don't include a full operating system - they share the host OS kernel.
* This makes the container faster, smaller and more efficient.
